# N-body Simulation Project 
The aim of this project is to simulate the gravitational interactions between a large number of particles (or bodies) using an N-body simulation.
The N-body problem is a classical problem in physics and computational science where the goal is to predict the motion of a system of particles under the influence of physical forces, such as gravity. 
The project made 2 versions as parallel and serial
The reason of making 2 versions are to show parallel version is faster than serial version with using openMP and The program was parallelized thanks to Openmp
